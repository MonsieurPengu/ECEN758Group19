## Abstract
Understanding and analyzing high-dimensional datasets is a cornerstone in modern data mining and machine learning. In this project, we employed PCA and t-SNE dimensionality reduction techniques to uncover meaningful patterns in Fashion-MNIST, a benchmark for image classification. We investigate the effectiveness of various conventional machine learning models, such as Decision Trees and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), together with deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for classifying fashion items. Variance analysis is the core of our feature extraction pipeline that ensures sound pre-processing to have the best performance out of a chosen model. In this regard, through comparative studies, we can showcase how dimensionality reduction interacts with classification performance for different methods. Our work underlines the considerable effects of reduction in dimensions on computational efficiency and accuracy; it therefore provides practical insights into both classical and neural network-based methods for high-dimensional data tasks.<br/>

We have recently witnessed a rapid evolution in data-driven technologies, including unprecedented advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, some of which have taken place in image analysis. The current stream of innovation is fueled by newer data sets, such as Fashion-MNIST, its alternative being the classic MNIST dataset. Unlike its predecessor, Fashion-MNIST would be more intricate, focusing on a challenge within classification tasks for gray-scale images of different garments. It thus provides extra complexity and, therefore, is a great benchmark for machine learning and deep learning algorithms.<br/>

## Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Conclusion
In summary, our analysis of the Fashion-MNIST dataset has provided key insights into the performance and applicability of various machine learning and deep learning models in regard to image classification. K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees provided baselines using conventional approaches, whereas the Support Vector Machine stood out for its strong performance in classification among conventional algorithms. While Artificial Neural Networks introduced the benefit of capturing complex data patterns for better accuracy, the classical methods were still lacking. Convolutional Neural Networks, designed for image-based tasks, outperformed all other methods by utilizing their strengths in extracting hierarchical and spatial features. The study has also pointed out the use of PCA and t-SNE dimensionality reduction techniques in enhancing computational efficiency without losing critical data features. Hyperparameter tuning of the CNN model resulted in higher gains, implying that good performance involves iterative optimization of the model. This extensive assessment therefore underlines the importance of making model selection and optimization strategies conform to characteristics in a dataset, hence providing a framework through which high-dimensional image classification challenges can be addressed. These findings not only reinforce the versatility of CNNs but also provide actionable insights for future explorations in data mining and machine learning.<br/>
